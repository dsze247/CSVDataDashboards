# CSV Data Dashboard
This code allows someone to input a csv file containing a table with the columns: date, product, quantity, revenue. Then the program will show statistics and graphs related to the inputed file.

In order to run my code, you will require a couple external packages. Use these commands to download the required packages:

```
npm install papaparse
npm install @tanstack/react-table
```

## Code Breakdown
For this project I broke the goal down into two parts, functionality and UI. From there, I further broke down the functionality part into each of the separate components I want to implement.

Functionality Breakdown:
- Data input
    - File chooser
    - Error handling
    - Parsing buttoon
